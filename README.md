# LotteryGame

This repo shows the uses of Javascript combined with <a href="https://jquery.com/">Jquerys</a> library. We are creating <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp">listeners</a> on our images. These specific listeners are waiting for a user's click and perfoming a certain actions. Here we have the images choosing a random number between 1-12, and pushing the result to a combined score. Then we are checking if our score passes or equals the randomly generated number. Depending on which outcome happens the game will increase losses or wins and reset the game. Included in the JQuery library we are able to add animation by again linking out images to specified directions on the screen. 

## Perquisites
